# Scala hands-on

## Purpose
This repo contains some simple scala projects I coded while learning this language. The rock-the-scala-beginners project contains few simple scala exercises to undestand the basics like values, variable, built-in types, expressions, functions and so on.

## How to create a scala project in Idea
I used IntelliJ Idea community edition as IDE. You have many options to create a scala project in Idea even if the recommended one is to use SBT scala dependency management and build tool.
I experienced some issues during this set up using the latest version of SBT (e.i 1.2) and 2017.2.5 Idea on my Sierra mac. To solve it I had to downgrade SBT to 1.0.4 version. With this version everything seems to work properly now.
